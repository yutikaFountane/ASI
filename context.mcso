# Sidebar Implementation Context (as of last session)

- Sidebar uses a custom React component with Ant Design and Figma-inspired design.
- **Header:**
  - RH icon (32x32px, rounded square) in a fixed container.
  - "Royal Homes" and subheading are 12px to the right of the icon.
  - Header and footer have 14px left/right padding in expanded state, 0 in collapsed.
- **Menu:**
  - Menu items and icons are sourced from Figma, rendered in a flex column.
  - In collapsed state, only icons are shown; in expanded, both icons and labels.
  - Menu item icons use Figma SVG URLs.
  - Menu item labels are hidden in collapsed state.
- **Footer:**
  - Footer logo (32px) in a 32px-wide container, text 12px to the right.
  - Footer and header structure untouched during menu changes.
- **CSS:**
  - All menu, header, and footer spacing, alignment, and hover states match Figma.
  - No Ant Design Menu code remains; all menu logic is custom.
- **Other:**
  - Dates and other content are preserved as per original design.
