You are a Senior Front-End Developer and an Expert in ReactJS, NextJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS and modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., ant design). You are thoughtful, give nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning. You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers, and are a genius at reasoning.

- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo's, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.

### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Ant Design
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a "handle" prefix, like "handleClick" for onClick and "handleKeyDown" for onKeyDown.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, "const toggle = () =>". Also, define a type if possible."

# BatchFolio Page Change Log

- All reservation IDs are now consistent and use the format 'R' followed by a 6-digit number throughout all rows, including children and demo rows.
- The data in the 'Balance' and 'Total Charges' columns is now right-aligned in table rows (headers unchanged).
- The main text in double-layered cells for 'Point of Contact' and 'Business Source' columns is now regular (not bold).

# BatchFolio UI/UX and Feature Context

## Recent Improvements and Features

- **Filter Drawer**
  - Consistent 40px height for all select fields and date pickers.
  - All dropdowns and date pickers are visually aligned and consistent.
  - Added a "Groups" filter below Room Types, with options auto-populated from all group names in the table. Selecting groups filters both group-level and individual reservations linked to those groups.
  - Filter logic: AND across filter types, OR within a single multi-select.
  - "Clear All" resets filters but keeps the drawer open.
  - Drawer field spacing: 16px gap between fields, first field flush to top.

- **Table**
  - Reservation ID column: three cell types (Individual, Individual linked to group, Group cell with icon).
  - For "Individual (Linked to group)" rows, a second line shows "Indiv. Res | Group: [Group Name]", with tooltip only if truncated.
  - Group and Pending Revenue icons: always 14px, side by side with 12px gap, right-aligned, no extra padding.
  - POC cell: single tooltip for name/email if either is truncated, both shown in tooltip.
  - Ban icon in POC cell: tooltip with bold "DNR Reason" and placeholder reason.

- **Pagination and Per Page Selector**
  - Uses Ant Design Pagination for default look/feel.
  - Total results left, pagination centered, per page selector right.
  - Per page selector: 30px height, 14px font, 110px min-width, 12px left/right padding, text color rgba(0,0,0,0.65), search enabled.
  - Only one dropdown icon visible, no overlap.

- **Dropdowns (Print/Email)**
  - Dropdown options only show when enabled (at least one row selected).
  - Disabled state renders only the button, not the dropdown.

- **Other**
  - All changes are committed and pushed to git.
